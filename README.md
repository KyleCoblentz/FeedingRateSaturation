This repository contains the data and code for the analyses in Coblentz et al. 'Predator feeding rates may often be unsaturated under typical prey densities'

The repository contains the following folders:

Data Set Up -- This folder contains the modified FoRAGE data, the mass-abundance scaling data from Hatton et al., the code to fit the Bayesian regressions for
the mass-abundance scaling relationships, and code to calculate the saturation index and produce the dataset used for analysis
